So close.  I crossed into the veil today, the souls flocked to me like moths to light, becoming me, imploring me to take them back.  But I was only in search of one.  I called out to her, shouting into the void.  And moments later I heard a response.  

It was her, I’m sure of it.  But the shock of hearing her voice, paired with the strain and exhaustion of guarding myself caused by concentration to faulted.  I was almost lost, only escaping by the skin of my teeth.  I was so close, tomorrow, I WILL bring her back.
