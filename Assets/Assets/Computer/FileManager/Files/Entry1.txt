Jenna is getting worse with each passing day.  Ive tried everything, reached out to practitioners and specialists worldwide, they all say the same.  Chase has been a great help; tending the house, cheering her up.  But I see his patience wearing thin.  I can see the doubt in his eyes each time I discuss cures with him.  I don’t know what to do anymore.
